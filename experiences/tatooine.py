        "explain": "The narrative gives the investigation a clear purpose. The scientific task is to translate story evidence into variables and filters.",

        "watch": "Avoid treating every visual detail from a film as a precise scientific measurement.",
    },

        "explain": "Before filtering, inspect what each row and column represent and how much information is missing.",
        "ask": "What does a missing value tell us?",
        "expected": "Only that this property is unknown or unavailable in this table.",
        "idea": "Data quality affects which questions can be answered.",
        "watch": "Students may interpret missing as zero or as evidence that a candidate qualifies.",

        "explain": "Operationalising means converting an idea into a measurable rule.",
        "ask": "How can 'two suns' become a filter?",

        "explain": "The first filter removes systems that do not have exactly two known stars and separately counts records with missing star data.",
        "ask": "Should unknown star counts be kept as possible matches?",
        "expected": "They can be labelled unknown, but they cannot be counted as confirmed matches.",

        "explain": "The original notebook assumes a three-planet system. This is a modelling choice rather than a fact established by the films.",
        "ask": "What happens if we use 'at least three' instead of 'exactly three'?",
        "expected": "More candidates remain because the criterion is broader.",
        "idea": "Analytical choices shape the result.",
        "watch": "Students may think a filter is objectively correct simply because it is coded into the app.",
